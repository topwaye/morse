# MORSE
Morse Operating System

A 286 CPU is like an old style battery charger.

MORSE is alternatively called header 286 segments. A 286 CPU can control memory segments directly, but a 386 CPU doesn't. It controls memory segments through headers which give them spaces. No header, no concept of space, only memory segments.

When booting, MORSE program is read into a memory segment from a disk, then sets a page table (i.e. a header), which puts this memory segment into a space, preparing for CPU paging.

Once CPU paging is enabled, the first process has been ready.

For the second process, the first process allocates a new page table and a new memory segment, maps them in (i.e. adds them to the page table of the first process), for reading or writing a new program into the new memory segment, and setting the new page table, then maps them out (i.e. removes them from the page table of the first process), now the second process is ready, assigns a new CPU for this new one.

The concept of segment appeared in 286, and the concept of space appeared in 386.

286 memory layout is shown as follows:

+-----------program0-----------++-----------program1-----------+

386 memory layout is shown as follows:

+--header0--++-----------program0-----------++--header1--++-----------program1-----------+

386 memory expanded layout is shown as follows:

+--header0--++--interrupt service program--++--program0--++--header1--++--interrupt service program--++--program1--+
